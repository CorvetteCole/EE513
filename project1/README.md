# Project 1
## Usage
Make sure you have activated the virtual environment. If you haven't, you can do so with `source ../venv/bin/activate` (or `../venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows) 
```shell
python generate_random_tones.py
python generate_scale.py
```

You may also manually generate notes on a scale with a reference frequency using `project1/tone_gen.py`. Run any python
file with the `-h` or `--help` flag to see the available options.
